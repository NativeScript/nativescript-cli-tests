Usage:
    $ tns debug ios [--debug-brk | --start] [--device <Device ID> | --emulator <Emulator Options>] [--no-client]

Example usage:
    $ tns debug ios --debug-brk
    $ tns debug ios --start
    $ tns debug ios --debug-brk --emulator
    $ tns debug ios --start --emulator

Debugs your project on a connected device or in a native emulator.

<Device ID> is the index or name of the target device as listed by $ tns list-devices.

Before debugging on iOS device, verify that you have configured a valid pair of development certificate and provisioning profile on your OS X system.
Debugging on iOS device will forward the debugging traffic on port 8080 from the device to the local machine.

Debugging on emulator will require an already started emulator and Xcode 6 or later.

Options:
    --debug-brk - Shorthand for prepare, build and deploy.
        Prepares, builds and deploys the application package on a device or in an emulator,
        launches the developer tools of your Safari browser.
    --start - Attaches the debug tools to a deployed and running app.
        Your app must be running on device or emulator,
        launches the developer tools of your Safari browser.
    --emulator - Debug on already running emulator. Requires "xcrun" from Xcode 6 or later.
    --no-client - Suppresses the launch of the developer tools in Safari.
