Creates a new project for native development with NativeScript from the default template or from an existing NativeScript project.
The specified name must meet the requirements of all platforms that you want to target. 
For projects that target Android, you can use uppercase or lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores. The name must start with a letter.
For projects that target iOS, you can use uppercase or lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens. 

Options:
--path - Specifies the directory where you want to create the project, if different from the current directory.
The directory must be empty.
--appid - Sets the application identifier for your project. The application identifier must be a domain name in reverse and must
meet the requirements of all platforms that you want to target.
For projects that target Android, you can use uppercase or lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores in the strings of the reversed domain name, separated by a dot. Strings must be separated by a dot and must start with a letter. For example: com.nativescript.My_Andro1d_App
For projects that target iOS, you can use uppercase or lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens in the strings of the reversed domain name. Strings must be separated by a dot. For example: com.nativescript.My-i0s-App
If not specified, the application identifier is set to org.nativescript.<App name>.
--copy-from - Specifies a directory which contains an existing NativeScript project. 
If not set, the Telerik NativeScript CLI creates the project from the default hello-world template.
