Usage:
    $ tns platform <Command>
    $ nativescript platform <Command>

You must run the platform command with a related command.

<Command> is a related command that extends the platform command. You can run the following related commands:
    list - Lists all platforms that the project currently targets. You can build and deploy your project only for
           these target platforms.
    add - Configures the current project to target the selected platform. After adding the target platform, you can
          build and deploy your app on devices which run on the platform.
    remove - Removes the selected platform from the platforms that the project currently targets. After removing
             the target platform, you can no longer build and deploy your app on devices which run on the platform.
             This operation deletes all platform-specific files and subdirectories from your project.
    update - Updates the NativeScript runtime for the specified platform.
