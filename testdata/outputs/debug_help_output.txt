Usage:
    $ tns debug android [--device <Device ID> | --emulator <Emulator Options> | --geny <Geny Name> ] [--debug-brk | --start | --stop | --get-port] [--debug-port <port>]
    $ tns debug ios [--device <Device ID>] [--debug-brk | --start ]
    
Platform-specific usage:
    $ tns debug android --get-port
    $ tns debug android --debug-brk [--debug-port <port>]
    $ tns debug android --start [--debug-port <port>]
    $ tns debug android --stop
    $ tns debug ios --debug-brk
    $ tns debug ios --start

Debugs your project on a connected device or in a native emulator.

<Device ID> is the index or name of the target device as listed by $ tns list-devices
<Port> is an accessible port on the device to which you want to attach the debugging tools.

Before debugging on iOS device, verify that you have configured a valid pair of development certificate and provisioning profile on your OS X system.

Options:
    --device - Specifies a connected device on which to run the app.
    --emulator - (Android-only) Specifies that you want to debug the app in the native Android emulator from the Android SDK.
    --geny - (Android-only) Specifies a Genymotion emulator on which you want to debug your app.
    --debug-brk - Shorthand for prepare, build and deploy. Prepares, builds and deploys the application package on a device or in an emulator,
        launches the app and loads the debug tools in the browser.
        For Android, launches the Chrome DevTools of your Chrome browser. You must have Chrome installed on your system.
        For iOS, launches the developer tools of your Safari browser.
    --start - Attaches the debug tools to a deployed and running app. Your app must be running on device.
    --stop - (Android-only) Detaches the debug tools.
    --get-port - (Android-only) Retrieves the port on which you are debugging your application.
        On iOS devices, this option is not available because the debug tools always attach to port 8080.
    --debug-port - (Android-only) Sets a new port on which to attach the debug tools.
        On iOS devices, this option is not available because the debug tools always attach to port 8080.
