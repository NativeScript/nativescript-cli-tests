    platform remove                 Removes the selected platform from the platforms that the project currently targets.
                                    This operation deletes all platform-specific files and subdirectories from your project.
    platform update                 Updates the NativeScript runtime for the specified platform.
    library add                     Adds a locally stored native library to the current project.
    prepare                         Copies relevant content from the app directory to the subdirectory for the selected target platform. 
                                    This lets you build the project with the SDK for the selected platform and deploy it on device.
    build                           Builds the project for the selected target platform and produces an application package or an
                                    emulator package.
    deploy                          Deploys the project to a connected physical or virtual device.

    run                             Runs your project on a connected device or in the native emulator, if configured. 
                                    This is shorthand for prepare, build, and deploy.
    debug                           Debugs your project on a connected device. 
    device                          Lists all recognized connected physical or virtual device.
